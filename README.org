* pi-turtle
The pi-turtle is an open source and free to use project to build a ethernet
to usb adaptator from scratch on a budget. this file contains the tutorial on
how to make this and all of the recommended software is provided in this
repository.

** Prerequisites
To be able to do this project I supose that you have the ability to solder
and that you know your way around linux at a basic level. Other than that
you should be fine by following the different instructions :)

**  Part I: Soldering the board
This first step is soldering the different boards, you need to have the
different pinout layed out in front of you with a little bit of solder
on them. The objective is to get everything "Ready" before we start putting
things together. You first need to remove the pins from the Ethernet module
if you have some on your model the objective is to make it as flush as possible,
like this:

Then I recommend adding some solder on the Raspberry Pi Zero.
